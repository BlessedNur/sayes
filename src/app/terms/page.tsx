          <p className="has-black-color has-text-color">
            Direct debit is a payment service which means that payments are made from the Payer's account at the initiative of the payee. In order for the Payer to be able to pay via Autogiro, the Payer must give his consent to the payee that he may initiate payments from the Payer's account. In addition, the Payer's payment service provider (e.g. bank or payment institution) must approve that the account can be used for Autogiro and the payee must approve the Payer as a user of Autogiro. The Payer's payment service provider is not obliged to test the authorization of or notify the Payer in advance of requested withdrawals. Withdrawals are charged to the Payer's account according to the rules applicable at the Payer's payment service provider. The Payer receives notification of withdrawals from his payment service provider. The consent can be transferred at the Payer's request to another account with the payment service provider or to an account with another payment service provider. The payer must immediately notify the payee of this.

            The payer will be notified by the payee of the amount, due date and method of payment no later than eight banking days before the Due Date. This can be announced before each individual Due Date or at one time regarding several future Due Dates. If the notification refers to several future Due Dates, the notification must be submitted no later than eight banking days before the first Due Date. However, this does not apply to cases where the Payer has approved the withdrawal in connection with the purchase or order of goods or services. In such a case, the Payer receives notification from the payee about the amount, due date and method of payment in connection with the purchase and/or order. By signing this consent, the Payer gives his consent for payments covered by the payee's notification according to this point to be carried out.
