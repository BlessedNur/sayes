        <ol  className="list-decimal pl-6 my-4">
          <li><strong> What is the data used for?</strong></li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>We only process your data for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy. In most cases, we need the data to be able to provide the services you requested. In some cases we also want to provide other services and then we ask you for your consent for these services. This section contains information about what we use your personal data for and which legal basis we have for each case.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Management of your membership agreement</strong></p>
        <p>We process your data in order to be able to fulfill your membership agreement and safeguard the rights and fulfill the obligations included in that.</p>
        
        <p>The information is used to identify you as a customer, to provide your access to our facilities, participation in training sessions and other activities included in your membership, for support and to answer questions about your membership. We also process your personal data for our administration, such as invoicing or other payment of your membership and additional services, for credit reporting purposes, to handle complaints and complaints, to help you with questions about your service or membership agreement when you contact our Customer Service. In some cases, we also record conversations at the conclusion of the agreement to ensure our agreement, as well as for training and quality purposes.</p>
        
        <p>Even when you contact our Customer Service, we may sometimes record calls and save chats for educational purposes to ensure our quality.</p>
        
        <p>Your personal data is also used for sending information as part of the agreement, for example changes to membership conditions, information about non-standard opening hours and events. For these purposes, we want to communicate with you by letter, SMS, MMS, telephone, e-mail, via our website and on social media where we are active from time to time. As can be seen below, the mailings may also contain direct mail, if you have consented to this.</p>
        
        <p>The legal basis for the above processing is the fulfillment of our contract with you. When we record calls and save chats, we have made the assessment that our interest in securing agreements and providing high quality service outweighs the risk that our processes would involve an infringement of your privacy.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Marketing</strong></p>
        <p>As part of your membership, we want to inform you about our various activities, services and products directly to you. We want our information to be relevant to your use of our services. Therefore, we compile statistics about which of our services you use to suggest new services and offers that we think you are interested in.</p>
        
        <p>We would also like to be able to send you advertisements for other products and services. For these purposes, we want to communicate with you by letter, SMS, MMS, telephone, email and via our web and on the social media where we operate from time to time.</p>
        
        <p>In order to receive advertising from us, we ask for your consent to receive direct mail. You can whenever preferably withdraw consent to change your settings on My Pages. If you withdraw consent, you will still receive our information mailings that do not contain advertising, see above.</p>
        
        <p>We would also like to use photos of our members for our marketing on the Internet, our mailings and on social media. If it becomes relevant, we will ask you if we can use pictures of you for such marketing.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Compliance with laws</strong></p>
        <p>We also process your personal data for the purpose of fulfilling our statutory obligations, to the extent required for this. Examples of services that may occur for this purpose are storage of invoicing documents to fulfill our obligation according to the Accounting Act.</p>
        
        <p>In cases where camera surveillance takes place, the aim is to prevent and investigate crime and create a safe and secure environment for you as a member. We have assessed that the interest in this, especially based on the limited areas that were intended, outweighs the interest in personal privacy.</p>
        
        <p>We also release your information to the police upon request if it is relevant for an investigation of criminal suspicions.</p>
        
        <ol  className="list-decimal pl-6 my-4">
          <li><strong> How is your data collected?</strong></li>

        <p>In accordance with what appears above, there is camera surveillance, during which film recording takes place.</p>
        
        <p>Which information we collect about you naturally depends on which of our services, activities and products that you use. To the extent that our processing of such personal data deviates from what appears in this privacy policy, we inform you in particular what the data is used for and on what basis we process them in connection with the data being collected.</p>
        
        <ol  className="list-decimal pl-6 my-4">
          <li><strong> How long is the data saved?</strong></li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>The information that we collect and that is generated when you use our services, activities and products are processed for different purposes. They are therefore also saved for different lengths of time depending on the situation on what they are to be used for and subject to our obligations under law. However, we never save personal data longer than we have to or as we deem reasonable.</p>
        
        <p>Unless we specify otherwise below, we save most of your personal data for as long as you are a customer with us. When the agreement between us has ended, your data is deleted (or anonymized) after 12 months, except when we are obliged by law to save them for a longer period of time. In order to be able to administer and offer you attractive service offers and carry out market and customer analysis, information about your use of our services is saved for 12 months from the start of processing.</p>
        
        <p>In the case of an unpaid invoice, the data is saved until the claim is settled or the statute of limitations has expired and it is no longer legally possible to make any objections to the invoicing, even if it is after the termination of the agreement.</p>
        
        <p>In the event that our customer service records calls for training purposes when you are in contact with them, these calls are saved for a reasonable time, but not longer than 12 months.</p>
        
        <p>Some of our facilities have camera surveillance. The surveillance footage is not saved for longer than we deem reasonable to fulfill the purpose of the surveillance, but no longer than 30 days.</p>
